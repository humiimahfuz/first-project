        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Humaira. I have a Bachelor's of Science from the University of Ottawa. I like hiking and taking photographs of the sunset. I'm also a big foodie and I love going out to eat with friends.</p>

    <div id="travel">
        <h2><strong>Travel</strong></h2>
        <p>My love of travelling stems from all the family vacations I took as a child. My father is a major adrenaline-junkie and he has a zest for life. He has been my source of inspiration to challenge myself and try out new things. During our trips, I would see him immerse himself in the culture and it allowed us to share meaningful experiences with each other. I feel very fortunate to have had these opportunities growing up and I hope to continue my travels in my adulthood. </p>

        <h2><strong>Photography</strong></h2>
        <p>Over the course of the pandemic, I pursued photography as a hobby. It has been a great source of comfort for me and it gave me the opportunity to connect with nature and be creative. My favourite time of the day to take photos is at sunset. </p>

         <h2> <strong>Fashion</strong></h2>
         <p>I have always enjoyed the thrill of shopping for new clothes and changing my style. I have always enjoyed reflecting my personality through my clothes and it is a source of confidence for me. One of the perks of living in Canada is that it allows me to experiment with fashion during the different seasons. My favourite season is Fall so I really enjoy styling jackets and turtlenecks during the colder seasons.</p>
